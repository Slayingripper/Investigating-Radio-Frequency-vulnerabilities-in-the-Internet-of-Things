## Hack RF 
## Zigbee 
The Zigbee protocol is a IOT specific protocol used for the transmission of data from sensors and automotation control networks using the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It uses very low data datarates of around 250Kpbs which operated on the microwave frequency allocation of 868 , 902-928 Mhz and 2.4 ghz frequencies. Usually higher frequencies are used to transfer data between devices at higher datarates but closer range. Usually Zigbee devices have a maximum range of 100m (assuming propagation allows)

### Zigbee infastracture 
The structure of the Zigbee network is consists of three main devices. The coordinator , Router and End Device . A zigbee network cannot function without a coordinator as is bridges the device with the network . The coordinator is in charge of storing and the information sent by the end device while the router with retransmit the data to the appropriate device .
